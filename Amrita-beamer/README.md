Amrita-beamer
=============
Beamer is a LaTeX class for creating slides for presentations.
This repository contains the beamer presentation of the Amrita
University.

How to compile
==============
If you are using GNU/Linux box, I would suggest you to install
texmaker editor and texlive-full package to compile any LaTeX 
files. 
(in debian based machines)
$ sudo apt-get install texmaker texlive-full

Once you open the tex file using the texmaker, you can run a 
quick-build to compile and get the PDF file as output.
